# CppPlotLib
Matlab plotting syntax in C++ using Gnuplot

When Gnuplot is installed this library can be used inside of your C++ program to plot using Matlab syntax. 

It uses a pipe to Gnuplot. 

It will be able to do "all" the plots Matlab can. 

This was created because plotting in C++ is always annoying.
